# <Prework Study Guide>

## Generated a webpage that included examples of html, css, and javascript, with notes on each. 

My motivation was to finish the pre work portion of the coding bootcamp successfully.
This site allows me to sandbox new techniques and ideas. 
I learned about VS Code and Github functionality, as well as gitbash commands.
